        One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat over
        their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the grey
        smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names were
        Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and were noted
        as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge
        and new discovery.
